# vcheeze

This project contains the source code for [my GitHub page](https://vcheeze.github.io).
It's built using [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev), a framework for building
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps.

Get the contents from the `__sapper__/export/` folder in your project and copy
it to [vcheeze.github.io](https://github.com/vcheeze/vcheeze.github.io). This
copies the sapper-generated static files so that GitHub Pages can serve them as
a website. I will look into how to automate this process in the future.
